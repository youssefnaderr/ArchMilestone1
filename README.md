# ArchMilestone1
computer archeticture course first milestone 
This project was developed by Youssef nader 900226170 and Youssef attalah 900221247. 
It implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor that supports all 42 base RV32I instructions. 
The design assumes that the instructions to be executed are preloaded in the instruction memory in sequential order. 
All components, including the ALU, control unit, register file, instruction/data memory, and immediate generator, function as expected. 
The processor has been fully tested, and all supported instructions work correctly. 
minor issues were encountered during testing but it was solved.
